In our technology era, knowing how to program is almost a must. Either you may want to develop your own website to show your work, or basically create a short snippet for excel to do your tiresome task you need to have basic understanding of programming. Great news if you are a self-learner person, there are lots of sources on the Internet which can help you to start your programming career!

Learning how to code is like learning other languages, first you start with its 'grammar', you learn how to construct basic statements and then you learn how to construct more complex statements by thinking with that language.

What I learnt during my studies: "You need to practice to learn programming". If you want to learn python then open Youtube and find some tutorials and create your demo project. You want to learn how to develop website? Do not wait for some courses, google it and start developing your own website.

I personally recommend starting with Java but it can be a biased thought since my first language was Java. I think it is easy to learn therefore you can have more focus on Object Oriented principles. When you get comfortable with Java it will be easier to learn C++, C# when you need them. I find C++ a useful language to write more efficient programs and using C# you can work on backend(although quite cumbersome). After Java, learning these new languages, working with OO structures will be easier. 

I also recommend you to have a basic Python understanding, I believe programming python and writing small snippets is faster and easier than other languages.

I started web development very late, my focus was generally on my studies so unfortunately I delayed it quite a lot. But I think web development is more fun than simply making programming projects. You can improve yourself everyday and you can easily share what you have done with the world. Also if you want to develop a stand alone project for a hackathon or work as a free lancer, you need to know how to do web / app development and communicate using APIs!


Do not worry about your theoretical courses, do internships, take part in projects and trust yourself! 

Doing practice is the best teacher of a developer!
